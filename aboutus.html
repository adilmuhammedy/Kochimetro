                <p>The metro ticket booking system website is designed to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to book metro tickets and access various functionalities related to their journey. The website incorporates several key features that enhance the user experience and simplify the ticket booking process.

                  One of the main functionalities of the website is the ability to book multiple tickets. Users can select the number of tickets they require for their journey, whether it's for a single trip or multiple trips.

                  Another important functionality is the fare calculator, which helps users determine the fare for their journey. By inputting their starting point and destination, the fare calculator calculates the total fare based on the distance traveled and any applicable discounts or concessions.

                  The water metro feature is designed for metro systems that include water transport modes, such as ferries or boats, along with traditional metro rail services. This functionality allows users to book water metro tickets, select departure and arrival points for water-based travel, and access specific information related to water transport, such as seating arrangements and safety guidelines.
                  
                  The metro card functionality enables users to apply their metro cards online.  This feature eliminates the need for users to queue up at ticket counters and provides them with a convenient way to access metro services.
                  
                  The lost and found functionality assists users in reporting lost items or finding their lost belongings within the metro premises. Users can submit details about their lost items, such as a description, date, and location of loss.
                  
                  Overall, the metro ticket booking system website provides users with a comprehensive platform to book tickets, access fare information, explore attractions, recharge metro cards, and report lost items.
